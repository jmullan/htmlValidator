Contributing
============

Code, Features, Bugs
--------------------

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the [main htmlValidator repository](https://github.com/Watermelon-Sauce/htmlValidator) on GitHub.
1. Once you've cloned the repository to your development environment, run `make` from the command line. This will ensure dependencies are properly installed
1. Create a local branch for the feature or bug that you would like to contribute.
1. Write code, commit, repeat.
    1. Always include or update unit tests for every change that you make.
    1. If you ran `make` before you started, a git pre-commit hook will prevent you from committing with any failing unit tests or lint-ridden code.
1. Once you are ready, push your branch to github and create a [pull request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/).
1. It is highly recommended to include relevant links to the [W3C HTML5 specs](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/spec.html) with your pull request to make verification faster.
